# Person Search GCN Project
This project implements Context Graph of paper [Learning Context Graph for Person Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01830) (CVPR 2019 Oral). 

This repository shows how we can use graph convolution model to employ context information and improve person search performance. 


## Environment:
python(3.6),
pytorch(0.4.1),
numpy(1.14.1), 
matplotlib(3.0.2),
tqdm,
pickle


## Preparation

1. Clone this repo 

  ```Shell
  git clone https://github.com/sjtuzq/person_search_gcn.git
  ```

2. modify data_path, log_path and neighbor_num in config.py

3. download dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-pjZd-bZFTqV2F_34jr0q77-iEmjE4P5), then put it into data_path folder. The features are generated by the method in [Joint Detection and Identification Feature Learning for Person Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.01850), whose code can be found [here](https://github.com/ShuangLI59/person\_search).

4. prepare dataset 
  generate the raw data feature into the paired form: persons in the same images are grouped together.

  ```Shell
  python prepare.py
  ```

## Experiments

1. train and test the gcn model

  train graph convolution model: with the pair selected by distance.

  ```Shell
  python train_gcn1.py
  ```
  The top-1 acc can be imporved from 78.6% to 81.6%, mAP from 75.4% to 80.2%.
